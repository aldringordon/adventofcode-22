# [Advent of code 2022](https://adventofcode.com)

I've particpated in this before but i've never actually seen it through till the end, holiday season is always a bit hectic

## Workflow

This is what im doing for each question:

**1. Setup env:**

Activate python virtual env (shouldnt even really be anything in it but just in case i do use some other non native libraries)

```
$ source env/bin/activate
(env) $
```

**2. Do the questions**

- Copy from the website any requirements such as test-data, input-data, etc.
- Create a solution *(even if its just a giant hack)*
- Submit answers *(preferabbly as fast as possible)*

**3. Archive work**

- Move solution into respective folder example: `/Day1-CalorieCounting`
- Push changes
  
**4. Post Submission Review (Optional)**

- Won't always have time to go back through my solution due to other commitments
- However, if im able to then ill go through my functions and try cleanup any mess/tech-debt in the solution
- This should help me out with starting the next days problem because the code has been simplified and hopefully is more reusable

**5. Teardown env**

Deactivate python environment ~~pls~~

```
(env) $ deactivate
$
```
